How did your user testing sessions go?

I asked family members so I think they were very kind on the review. It was also really cool to hear how impressed they were that I made a website like this.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
I tried to clean it up so it was simple on the home page, and added more pictures to a different page.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
I had a hard time trying to match things up, and use the css style sheet with 3 different pages. I wasn't sure if I needed a style sheet for each page, but I think I figured it out. I took things out to keep it simple so everything would be similar and not over decorated.
