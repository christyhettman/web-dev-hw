            Mildred is a 4 year old GWP who has an insane amount of energy. I call her Millie, short for Mildred. She loves to play fetch. Mini tennis balls are her favorite.

            Millie has a sister, Pearl. Pearl is a German Shorthair Pointer. She is grumpy and likes to take naps. Pearl loves food more than anything in this world.
